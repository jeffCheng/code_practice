## General Idea of System Design
- [What are system design questions?](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/system-design/lesson/52)
- Design high level architecture.  The typical outcome of such a discussion is a high-level architecture addressing the *goals* and *constraints* in the question. Perhaps the interviewer will choose one or more areas where they will want to discuss *bottlenecks* and other common problems.
- [Overview](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/system-design/lesson/53) 
   - Problems: Approach questions in a chaotic way and get ratholed, or
   - Problems: Lack solid understanding of how to properly design architectures that scale.
   - *The System Design Process*
   - *Designing Scalable Architectures*
#### Step 1: Constraints and use cases (quick likes 5 minutes to complete this section)
  - Clarify the `system's constraints` and to identify what `use cases` the system needs to satisfy. 
  - The scope of the system
  - Usually, part of what the interviewer wants to see is if you can gather the requirements about the problem at hand, and design a solution that covers them well. Never assume things that were not explicitly stated.
  - Tiny URL `Constraints` and `User case`
  - E.g: Design a url shortening service, like bit.ly
  - User case:
     1. Shortening: take a url => return a much shorter url
     2. Redirection: take a short url => redirect to the original ur
     3. Custom url
     4. High Availablity of the system
     5. Analytic - Out of scope
     6. Automatic link expiration - Out of scope
     7. Manual link removeal - Out of scope
     8. UI vs API - Out of scope
  - Constraint
      - 15 BN new tweets
      - All shortened URLs per month: 1.5BN
      - Sites below the top 3: shorten 300M per month
      - We: 100 MLM per month
  - Math:
      1. New urls per month: 100MLN
      2. 1 BN requests per month 
      3. 10% from shortening and 90% from redirection
      4. Requests per second: 400+ (40:shorens,360:redirects)
      5. Total urls:5 years * 12 months * 100MLN = 6 BN
      6. 500 bytes per URL
      7. 6 bytes per hash
      8. 3TBs for all urls, 36GB for all hashes(over 5 years)
      9 New data wirtten per second:40*(500+6): 20k
      10. Data read per second: 360*506 bytes: 180K
      

#### Step 2: Abstract design
  - The goal of this is to `outline` all the important components that your architecture will need.
      - Draw a simple diagram of your ideas(Sketch your main components and the connections between them)
      - Justify your ideas in front of the interviewer and try to address every constraint and use case.
      - You have to make sure you are familiar with what's out there and feel comfortable using this knowledge.
      - Abstract Desigin:
      1. Application service layer (serves the requests)
        - Shortening serivce
        - Redirection service
      2. Data storage layer(keeps track of the hash => url mappings)
        - Acts like a big hash table: stores new mappings, and retrieves a value given a key.

```hashed_url = convert_to_base62(md5(orginal_url+random_salt))[:6]```
      
#### Step 3: Understanding bottlenecks
   - Now that you have your high-level design, start thinking about what bottlenecks it has. 
     - Perhaps your system needs a load balancer and many machines behind it to handle the user requests
     - Or maybe the data is so huge that you need to distribute your database on multiple machines.
     - What are some of the downsides that occur from doing that?
     - Is the database too slow and does it need some in-memory caching?
   - Once you've outlined the core bottlenecks you see, you can start addressing them in the next step.
     - Traffic is probably not going to be very hard, data - more interesting.
#### Step 4: Scaling your abstract design
   - Address these bottlenecks by using the fundamentals principles of scalable system design.
