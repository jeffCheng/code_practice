# Ch1 Incremental Method 

## 1-1 Method 

### Selection Sort
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

- 1) The subarray which is already sorted.

- 2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.


```
def selection_sort(A):
    for i in range(len(A)):
        min_index = i
            for j in ranget(i+1, len(A)):
                if A[min_index] > A[j]:
                    min_idx = j
        A[i], A[min_index] = A[min_index], A[i]
```

4. Print Triangle:
```
def print_triangle(n):
  for i in range(n,0, -1):
    for j in range (0, i):
      print("A", end = '')
    print()

print_triangle(5)

```


```
def print_triangle(n):
  for i in range(1,n+1):
    for j in range (1, i+1):
      print("A", end = '')
    print()

print_triangle(5)
```


```
def print_diamond(n):
  for i in range(n):
    print(" "*(n-i), "*"*(i*2+1))
  for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
    print(" "*(n-i), "*"*(i*2+1))

print_diamond(5)
```
