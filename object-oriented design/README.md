## General Idea of System Design
- [What are system design questions?](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/system-design/lesson/52)
- Design high level architecture.  The typical outcome of such a discussion is a high-level architecture addressing the *goals* and *constraints* in the question. Perhaps the interviewer will choose one or more areas where they will want to discuss *bottlenecks* and other common problems.
- [Overview](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/system-design/lesson/53) 
   - Problems: Approach questions in a chaotic way and get ratholed, or
   - Problems: Lack solid understanding of how to properly design architectures that scale.

   - *Designing Scalable Architectures*
1. Step 1: Constraints and use cases
  - Clarify the `system's constraints` and to identify what `use cases` the system needs to satisfy. 
  - The scope of the system
  - Usually, part of what the interviewer wants to see is if you can gather the requirements about the problem at hand, and design a solution that covers them well. Never assume things that were not explicitly stated.
